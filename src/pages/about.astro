      <p>
        This site was built as an experiment in using <strong>Astro</strong> as a static site generator for a
        content-heavy project. The emphasis is on shipping <em>HTML and CSS</em> first, with JavaScript only where it
        would truly add value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of a single demo page, the project behaves like a small, opinionated blog. Posts are modeled as a
        <strong>content collection</strong>, then rendered through shared layouts and components so that the site feels
        cohesive and easy to maintain.
      </p>

      <h2>How this goes beyond a simple starter</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A reusable <code>BaseLayout</code> component wraps every page with the same header, footer, and overall
          chrome.
        </li>
        <li>
          The blog uses Astro&apos;s content collections instead of ad-hoc Markdown files sprinkled through
          <code>src/pages</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Listing pages and individual posts are all rendered statically, so navigation feels instant.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to explore the code</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Browse the <strong>home page</strong> to see shared components and a curated list of recent posts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Visit the <strong>blog index</strong> at <code>/blog/</code> to see how the content collection is queried.
        </li>
        <li>
          Open any post to inspect how Markdown, frontmatter, and the detail layout work together.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <code>src/layouts</code>, <code>src/components</code>, and <code>src/content</code> for a quick overview of how
        everything fits together.
